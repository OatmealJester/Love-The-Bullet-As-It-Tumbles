    "description": "Recovered from a previously hidden burial site recently exposed during the cataclysmic SM-D strike against Hivehome, this weapon is an incredible archaeological discovery as well as a peerless example of long forgotten Egregorian weapons forging techniques. Preliminary material analysis of the blade reveals an unusual composition consisting of traditional metallurgical alloys interwoven with long-chain keratin polymers, granting the weapon both its incredible durability as well as its unique iridescent sheen. The sword, formerly belonging to a member of the Egregorian warrior caste-strain known as Primaries or Primes, is also a functional osteomemetic with a series of recorded Witness subjectivities engraved along the length of the blade itself. It is in all respects a monumentally valuable relic of the past, a tangible expressionof a people's history and will to fight made manifest.",
